# Weekly External Audit / 每周外部维护巡检

This directory stores the independent weekly repository-maintenance record. It is **not** the observatory's canonical research Weekly under `reports/weekly/`.

## Cadence

Adopted from **2026-09-07**.

One real audit run produces at most one canonical file for its ISO week:

```text
YYYY-Www.md
```

The filename identifies the ISO week; `checked_at` inside the file identifies when the audit actually ran. Never backdate `checked_at` to make a missed audit look executed.

## Scope

Each weekly audit reads the current calendar month from day 1 through the actual `checked_at` date and checks, at minimum:

1. current `main` SHA and default branch;
2. open PRs, owners, head/base, changed-file overlap, mergeability/check visibility;
3. recent main commits and available Actions runs;
4. every real Daily report and Daily pack in the month;
5. the current Daily month index and count;
6. all canonical Weekly files touching the month, including opening/settlement state;
7. the current Monthly file and Monthly index without prematurely closing the month;
8. `SOURCE_REGISTRY.md` current-state claims and exact-object maturity semantics;
9. `watchlist/ACTIVE.md` current ranking and closed/open question state;
10. relevant month-to-date changes in `ledger/`, `history/`, `entities/`, and `maps/`;
11. root/current-state projection surfaces when they can contradict canonical research truth;
12. bounded independent external verification for high-impact policy/standard/data/infrastructure claims whose current state matters to the repository.

For this China observatory, spot checks prioritize first-party/current official surfaces such as CAC, SAMR/standard portals, MIIT, NDA, other government/regulator sources, standards text, official project/company sources, and primary international standards where cross-border comparison is materially used.

## Exact-object rule

Every current-state observation must keep exact object identity and exact maturity stage.

```text
policy target != completed capability
standard project != published standard
review != approval != publication != implementation
international approval != domestic adoption
observation date != transition date
```

If the official page presents a state that conflicts with earlier repository observations, preserve the earlier observations and update only the current interpretation.

## Weekly maintenance question

The weekly audit is not asking "what new research happened?" It asks:

```text
Does the month-to-date repository still project its canonical China research truth correctly,
with exact-object maturity, preserved observation chronology,
complete current-period records, and no stale current-state surface?
```

## Result

Exactly one:

```text
HEALTHY
REPAIR
COORDINATE
BLOCKED
```

If `HEALTHY`, repository action is `NO_CHANGE_REQUIRED` for research/implementation files; creating the scheduled external-audit record remains legitimate governance evidence.

If `REPAIR`, the record must name the owning file, current authoritative evidence, root cause, preserved history, minimum correction, observed validation, risk, and Draft PR boundary.

## Overlap with semimonthly audit

When a weekly audit and a semimonthly checkpoint occur close together, they may cross-reference one another to avoid duplicating prose. They must still independently refresh `main`, PR overlap, current canonical artifacts, and any material official-source state.

```text
cross-reference != inherited verification
```

## Historical correction

A merged weekly external-audit record is sealed point-in-time evidence. Later corrections use a dated successor such as:

```text
YYYY-Www-reconciliation-YYYY-MM-DD.md
```

Never rewrite a merged weekly audit to make an earlier run appear to have known later facts.
